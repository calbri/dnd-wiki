Delivering the Goods
=============

Origins of the Party
-------------

Each member of the party was hired by [Gundren](characters/gundren.md) in order to deliver a shipment of goods to the town of [Phandalin](locations/phandalin.md). However, whilst on this journey, two dead horses were found on the road. This greatly upset [Bardryn](characters/bardryn.md), and upon inspection it looked to be the work of goblins, with a clear path leading into the trees. Despite this, the party chose to first deliver their cargo to [Phandalin](locations/phandalin.md).

Entering Phandalin
-------------

Upon entering [Phandalin](locations/phandalin.md), the party decided to first deliver the goods to [Barthen](characters/barthen.md). However, after being compensated for their time it was revealed that the horses belonged to [Gundren](characters/gundren.md) and [Sildar](characters/sildar.md), who had most likely been kidnapped by goblins. While in town the party used illusion magic to charm a young lady into giving them some apples. The party also learned that the town was being held at the mercy of the vicious [Redbrands](factions/redbrands.md).

The party gathered some provisions and set off back towards the dead horses, intent on rescuing [Gundren](characters/gundren.md) from the clutches of the goblins.
