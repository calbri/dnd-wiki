Assault on the Redbrands
===========

Gathering Information
-----------

Within the town were a few contacts that were known to be against the [Redbrands](../factions/redbrands.md). It was decided that the party should first seek out these people to find out if anything could be done to stop this menace.

[Daran](../characters/daran.md), seeks to eliminate the [Redbrands](../factions/redbrands.md) from the town, and told the party about their hideout in the abandoned **Tresendar Manor**. He also spoke about their leader, [GlassStaff](../characters/glassstaff.md), however some people in the group were already aware of him and his power.

[Halia](../characters/halia.md) also showed interest in this quest, offering a reward for vanquishing [GlassStaff](../characters/glassstaff.md). However, the party felt some unease at Halia and her motives. It was found out that the [Redbrands](../factions/redbrands.md) often frequented the **Sleeping Giant** alehouse.

Sneaking into the Manor
-----------

In order to get into the manor, the party decided to obtain some [Redbrand](../factions/redbrands.md) attire in order to blend in for as long as possible. They went into the Sleeping Giant and picked a fight with a few grunts to lead them outside. After a quick and brutal ambush, several uniforms were acquired, allowing everyone to blend in.

Upon entering the manor however, the party failed to convince the thugs that they were [Redbrands](../factions/redbrands.md), leading to a fight and the start of an all-out assault on the manor.

While moving through the manor, a mother and daughter were found being held captive, among a larger pile of clothes which suggested other victims had been killed by the vicious [Redbrands](../factions/redbrands.md) earlier. Instructing them to hide, the party pressed on into an open area with a large crevasse.

The Nothic
-----------

In this area, some members of the party began to hear messages in their minds from an unknown source, revealing certain secrets about other members of the group. [Warryn](../characters/warryn.md) who did not want his secret revealed, picked a fight with the Nothic but was knocked out. Then it was revealed that [Warryn](../characters/warryn.md) was a former member of the [Redbrands](../factions/redbrands.md), to the surprise of the rest of the group. In addition, it was revealed that [Bardryn](../characters/bardryn.md) was female.
