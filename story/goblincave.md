The Goblin Cave
===========

Journey to the Cave
-----------

The party set off back towards the dead horses, a journey of half a day that turned out to be uneventful. Upon arrival, investigating the corpses revealed an empty map holder and signs of a struggle leading into the woods. Following this path revealed a cave, with a few goblins standing guard outside who were quickly dealt with.

Goblin Hideout
-----------

Venturing inside the cave, the party found two wolves chained up near the entrance. The plan was to cover the party in thick smoke and create an illusion of a sheep to lead the wolves to attack the goblins. However, this quickly devolved into chaos, leading to [Warryn](characters/warryn.md) falling unconscious and a hard fought battle against the wolves.

A small vertical path was revealed leading to another section of the cave. [Warryn](characters/warryn.md) and [Bardryn](characters/bardryn.md) went up, to reveal a bugbear and a few goblins poised to attack. Through some quick thinking, the bugbear was charmed and led to believe he was a friend of the party. The bugbear introduced himself as [Clarg](characters/clarg.md), the leader of this cave.

The Revolt
-----------

The party nervously played along with this charm, letting [Clarg](characters/clarg.md) lead them through the cave. He told them about his wolf, Ripper, and all his exploits over the years. However, not all the other goblins trusted his judgement about letting the party in, and this led to a fight between [Clarg](characters/clarg.md) and his loyal goblins against this mutinous group.

In the fighting, the party noticed a human chained up against the wall. Slipping past the chaos, they rescued him and left the goblins to fight amongst themselves. After the dust had settled, the only goblin left standing was [Clarg](characters/clarg.md), in anguish after the death of Ripper. Not wanting to hang around for the charm to dissipate, the party left the cave with the rescued human.

Along the way to the exit, a number of crates from a shipping company called the **Lionshield Coster** were found in one section of the cave, along with several rare trinkets.

Aftermath
----------

The rescued human revealed himself to be [Sildar](characters/sildar.md), who was travelling alongside [Gundren](characters/gundren.md) when he was kidnapped. The party decided to return to town.

Deciding to make a bit of extra coin, the party stopped at the **Lionshield Coster**. After a bit of awkward negotiation, the company offered to pay them to return the crates they had found. They also provided a mule and cart to carry these goods. Using their skills to speak to this mule, they learned of its sadness and wish to start a family.

The party set out back to the cave, and despite the constant feeling of being watched, returned the crates uneventfully.
